# Forest egui
Some bearable user interface.  
Still some work needs to be done:
- [ ] Limit sliders of elements to not go over area of the field

----
Kinda a lot of ~~stolen~~ code that highly inspired the project, mostly egui/eframe/epaint examples and code from egui.info and actions workflow from [fishfolk/jumpy](https://github.com/fishfolk/jumpy)
